*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying "pure sampling" of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and PI) to support engineering design.

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub) that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat transfer to fluid-suspended particles[1]. These simulations were carried out to help study a novel design of [solar receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power), though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your local `./data/` folder.

```{r data-download-unzip}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk

```

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png) Figure 1. An example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain (RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right). Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are "hot spots" where hot particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap` gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

### **q1** Perform your "initial checks" to get a sense of the data.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Perform your initial checks
# Basic structure and summary
glimpse(df_psaap)
summary(df_psaap)
```

**Observations**:

-   A lot of variables to keep track of (22 columns)
-   Each have 140 data points
-   Values appear to range a lot from large values to different amounts of decimal points (or sig figs)

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions `W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx

# Line plot showing each simulation's trajectory
ggplot(df_psaap, aes(x = x, y = T_norm, group = idx)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Position along column (x)", 
       y = "Normalized temperature rise (T_norm)",
       title = "Temperature Rise Along Fluid Column",
       subtitle = "Each line represents a separate simulation (idx)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation sets.

```{r data-split}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors (features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables---at least at a *high level*---can help us to avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You'll explore this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

```{r q3-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance

# Function to calculate RMSE
calculate_rmse <- function(model, data) {
  predictions <- predict(model, newdata = data)
  residuals <- data$T_norm - predictions
  sqrt(mean(residuals^2))
}

# Calculate RMSE for each model
rmse_baseline <- calculate_rmse(fit_baseline, df_validate)
rmse_cheat <- calculate_rmse(fit_cheat, df_validate)
rmse_nonphysical <- calculate_rmse(fit_nonphysical, df_validate)

# Create comparison table
model_comparison <- tibble(
  Model = c("Baseline (x)", "Cheat (avg_T)", "Non-physical (idx)"),
  RMSE = c(rmse_baseline, rmse_cheat, rmse_nonphysical)
)

# Display results
model_comparison %>% arrange(RMSE)
```

**Observations**:

-   Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
    -   The most accurate model is the Cheat (avg_t) as it has a value of 0.232 which is closer than 0.399 to the baseline 0.284
-   What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective predictor?
    -   avg_T is an output measurement and the absolute temperature measurement to find T_norm
    -   avg_Tis effective because it is directly used to calculate it with the formula T_norm = (avg_T - T_f)/T_f
-   Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new* value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
    -   No, because avg_T is predicted using new T_norm values. It would not be valid as it would be using circular reasoning and would require knowing avg_T first to find T_norm/
-   What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical meaning?
    -   idx is a metadata and means the simulation run. It's an arbitrary number to represent each simulation

### **q4** Interpret this model

Interpret the following model by answering the questions below.

*Note*. The `-` syntax in R formulas allows us to exclude columns from fitting. So `T_norm ~ . - x` would fit on all columns *except* `x`.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO: Inspect the regression coefficients for the following model
fit_q4 <- 
  df_train %>% 
  # lm(formula = T_norm ~ . - idx - avg_q - avg_T - rms_T)
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ . - idx - avg_q - avg_T - rms_T)
  # lm(formula = T_norm ~ L - W - U_0 - N_p - k_f - T_f)

tidy(fit_q4) %>% 
  mutate(term = fct_reorder(term, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = term)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = estimate - std.error,
                     xmax = estimate + std.error)) +
  labs(title = "Model Coefficients with 95% Confidence Intervals",
       x = "Effect Size",
       y = "Predictor")

summary(fit_q4)$coefficients %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "predictor") %>% 
  filter(`Pr(>|t|)` < 0.05)  # Significant if p-value < 0.05

df_psaap %>% 
  summarise(sd_x = sd(x), sd_Tf = sd(T_f))
```

**Observations**:

-   Which columns are excluded in the model formula above? What categories do these belong to? Why are these important quantities to leave out of the model?
    -   idx, avg_q, avg_T, rms_T are all removed from the mode. idx is removed as it just an identifer for each obsercation. The other 3 are likley predictors that are highly correlated with other variables in out data and so exclusion reduces multicollinarity.
-   Which inputs are *statistically significant*, according to the model?
    -   According to the mode x, L, W, U_0, C_fp, d_p and I_0 are all statistically signficant.
-   What is the regression coefficient for `x`? What about the regression coefficient for `T_f`?
    -   x = 1.0183
    -   T_f does not have one
-   What is the standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap`? What about the standard deviation of `T_f`?
    -   standard devation of x is 0,2805 and the SD for T_f is 38.9420
-   How do these standard deviations relate to the regression coefficients for `x` and `T_f`?
    -   The effect of X is 1.0183 (x) x 0.2805 (SD of x) = 0.2855 or a roughly 1SD in x leads to a 0.29 change increase in T_norm
    -   T_f was excluded so no regression coefficient was esimated. It has a large SD of 28,94 which suggest it has a large amount of variation.
-   Note that literally *all* of the inputs above have *some* effect on the output `T_norm`; so they are all "significant" in that sense. What does this tell us about the limitations of statistical significance for interpreting regression coefficients?
    -   statisitcal signiiance only tells us that an effect is liekly due to change
    -   It does not tell us the practical importance of a predictors like c_fp which is statistically significant but has a tiny effect
    -   A large coefficient may not be statistically signficiant if its uncertainty is high
    -   The predictors here are all statistically significant shows that the sample size may be large but does not mean the predictors are all equally important or useful for using the model to make predictions

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let's revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals (PI). Let's fit a very simple model to these data, one which only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We'll also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the `setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

```{r data-simple-model}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the objects they are attempting to capture:

```{r data-simple-model-vis}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    size = 0.5
  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"
  )
```

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation` observations.

**Punchline**:

-   Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
-   Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to *narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions. Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in uncertainty. We'll see this phenomenon in action with the following task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Run this code and interpret the results
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
## NOTE: This chunk will use your model from q4; it will predict on the
##       validation data, add prediction intervals for every prediction,
##       and visualize the results on a predicted-vs-actual plot. It will
##       also compare against the simple `fit_simple` defined above.
bind_rows(
  df_psaap %>% 
    add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi") %>% 
    select(T_norm, pi_lwr, pi_fit, pi_upr) %>% 
    mutate(model = "x only"),
  df_psaap %>% 
    add_uncertainties(fit_q4, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi") %>% 
    select(T_norm, pi_lwr, pi_fit, pi_upr) %>% 
    mutate(model = "q4"),
) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(T_norm, pi_fit)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "grey80", size = 2) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = pi_lwr, ymax = pi_upr),
    width = 0
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  
  facet_grid(~ model, labeller = label_both) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted vs Actual",
    x = "Actual T_norm",
    y = "Predicted T_norm"
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this predicted-vs-actual plot?
    -   The left panel model seems to be more accurate as the values are less scattered.
-   Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
    -   the q4 only model is more confident as the vertical bars in the right panel are consistnelty more narrow than those on the left. This means that the x only has less uncertainty in its predictions on new data.
-   How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
    -   it would need 7 predictor of x L W U_0 c_fp d_p and I_0

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example, it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is *patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component* that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases---human behavior and variable material properties---we would be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term $\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below (use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` with the `level` argument!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing a CI or PI for the design prediction.

```{r q6-task}
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`

## Fit a model with the key controllable variables
fit_q6 <- lm(T_norm ~ x + L + W + U_0, data = df_train)

## Get prediction interval for the design point
design_pred <- predict(fit_q6, newdata = df_design, 
                      interval = "prediction", level = pr_level) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(T_norm_pred = fit, pi_lwr = lwr, pi_upr = upr)

## Check coverage on validation data
validation_pred <- predict(fit_q6, newdata = df_validate, 
                          interval = "prediction", level = pr_level) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(T_norm_pred = fit, pi_lwr = lwr, pi_upr = upr) %>% 
  bind_cols(df_validate %>% select(T_norm))

# Calculate coverage rate
coverage_rate <- mean(validation_pred$T_norm >= validation_pred$pi_lwr & 
                      validation_pred$T_norm <= validation_pred$pi_upr)

design_pred
coverage_rate
```

**Recommendation**:

-   How much do you trust your model? Why?
    -   I trust my model with a moderate to high confidence as it surpasses the 80% coverage threshold and manages to get 93.3% coverage
-   What kind of interval---confidence or prediction---would you use for this task, and why?
    -   I would use prediction because we are accounting for individual device performance not the trend. It would be finding new data from that device.
-   What fraction of validation cases lie within the intervals you predict? (NB. Make sure to calculate your intervals *based on the validation data*; don't just use one single interval!) How does this compare with `pr_level`?
    -   0.933 is what I predicted. This is over the pr_level meaning that this is overly conservative.
-   What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan around?
    -   they should design around x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0, that we were given as it is likely that this model covers more than the required amount (80%) of values to account for. This means a T_norm value between 1.45685 and 2.296426
-   Are there any other recommendations you would provide?
    -   Keep the current 80% prediction interval (PI): The model’s coverage of 93.3% is beneficial, as it provides a more conservative and safer range for T_norm, which is crucial for avoiding potential damage to equipment. It’s better to overestimate uncertainty than to risk missing critical variations.

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.

*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

``` r
df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
df_titanic
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 5
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154
    ## # ℹ 22 more rows

``` r
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- (List all variables here)

  The variables are Class, sex, age, survived and n/number of them
  (double).

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - Yes, according to the wiki article there is 2224 indivduals that
    survived. But the data set has 2201.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - Generally for large scale events like this things can happen like
    how data was retrieved. Such as reported from tickets sold, bodies

    collected etc. But still the difference is only about 20 people
    which is more than 1/100th of the total population.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
survivors <- df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex) %>%
  summarize(count = sum(n))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Class'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(survivors, aes(x = Class, y = count, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Count of Survivors", 
       x = "Class", 
       y = "Count of Survivors")
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- I notice that the highest amount of survivors go to Male crew members
  and lowest go to female crew.
- In most class cases minus crew, there were more female than male
  survivors.
- 3rd class was more even for male to female survivor split amount

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # ℹ 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop_survived <- df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes")

# Now plot proportion of survivors
ggplot(df_prop_survived, aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Survivors by Class and Sex", 
       x = "Class", 
       y = "Proportion of Group that Survived")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here.

- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?

  - The proportion after filtering to only survivors. That distorted the
    math made each bar represent the share of all survivors not the
    survival rate within each group. So it looked like survival was
    evenly distributed, even though that’s not true.

- <div>

  ### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

  </div>

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop2 <-
df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>% 
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") 
df_prop2
```

    ## # A tibble: 16 × 7
    ## # Groups:   Class, Sex, Age [16]
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total     Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child Yes          5     5   1     
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child Yes         11    11   1     
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child Yes         13    48   0.271 
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child Yes          0     0 NaN     
    ##  5 1st   Female Child Yes          1     1   1     
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child Yes         13    13   1     
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child Yes         14    31   0.452 
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child Yes          0     0 NaN     
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult Yes         57   175   0.326 
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult Yes         14   168   0.0833
    ## 11 3rd   Male   Adult Yes         75   462   0.162 
    ## 12 Crew  Male   Adult Yes        192   862   0.223

    ## 16 Crew  Female Adult Yes         20    23   0.870

``` r
ggplot(df_prop2, aes(x = Age, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Class)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +

**Observations**:

- ## (Write your observations here.)

- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - (Your response here)
  - The fishyness between the two graphs would be that in Q4 it appears
    that the survival rate of 1st and 2nd class is 100% when that simply
    is not the case. The data shows that while all the 1st and 2nd class
    children survived, there were at least 200 combined 1st and 2nd
    class men who did not. And about 20 1st and 2nd class women who did
    not.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
